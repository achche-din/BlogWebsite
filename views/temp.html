</h1>
<p>
  Inheritance is the concept of using the functionality offered by another class
  and building on top of it. This way, multiple new classes can build upon one
  class which is offering the base functionality.

</p>
<p>
  Only members of a class that are declared protected or public are inherited by
  subclasses.
</p>
<p>
  Method bodies aren't copied in the body of a subclass. Instead, when you call
</p>
<pre><code> Child child1 = new Child(); child1.method1(); </code></pre>
<p>
  It will look through its hierarchy, going up a level every time it can't find
  an implementation. First, it will check Child which has no implementation. One
  level above that there's Parent which does, so it will use that one. this is
  achieved via the super() call. The super keyword is used to refer to the
  object of the immediate parent class. The very first thing super does is
  initialize an object of parent class in constructor of the child class as
  shown in code below.
</p>
<pre><code> Child() { super(); parent_method(); } </code></pre>

</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Both classes are in the same logical domain and The subclass is a proper
      subtype of the superclass. Example: Sparrow IS-A Bird, Cat IS-A Animal.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The superclass&rsquo;s implementation is necessary or appropriate for the
      subclass
    </p>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400" aria-level="1">
    <p>The enhancements made by the subclass are primarily additive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you find that your subclass is removing things provided by the
      superclass, question inheriting from that superclass

</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Provide feature of Method overriding which helps in runtime polymorphism.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Code reusability: common code for all the derived classes of the parent
      class can be put in parent class so same code need not be put in multiple
      child classes hence reducing code redundancy.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Inheritance helps to extend features of the base class without affecting
      base class &ldquo;We need a widget that is just like the existing Widget
      class but with a few tweaks and enhancements&rdquo;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Inheritance helps programmer to model IS-A relationship in code which
      makes code easier to maintain(read, update, debug).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

  <span style="color: #993366"><strong>Drawbacks of Inheritance</strong></span>
</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Main disadvantage of using inheritance is that the two classes (base and
      inherited class) get tightly coupled. This means one cannot be used
      independently of each other. for example, during maintenance adding new
      features both base as well as derived classes are required to be changed.
      If a method signature is changed or a method is deleted in the
      "superclass", then we will have to re-factor in case of using that method
      in derived classes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      increased time/effort it takes the program to jump through all the levels
      of overloaded classes. If a given class has ten levels of abstraction
      above it, then it will essentially take ten jumps to run through a
      function defined in each of those classes.
    </p>

    ><strong>Real-Life Example of Inheritance</strong></span
  >
</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      suppose we have a Clock and we want to add a feature to set Alarm in it.
      Look at code below to see two possible design approach to solve this
      problem.
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/PUSHPENDRAKUMAR18270/33640daa37579ed1c93203f5b84a8d57.js"></script>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Which design do you think is better? Design with Inheritance removes
      redundant code as AlarmClock do not have to define its own method
      setTime() and getTime() it can inherit from Clock. Also, AlarmClock IS-A
      Clock. Code is a lot cleaner when this relationship is maintained.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
