</h1>
<p>
  A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data,
  typically stored electronically in a computer system. Data stored in a
  database can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled,
  and organized using a &ldquo;database management system&rdquo;.

    ><strong>What is Database Management System?</strong></span
  >
</h1>
<p>
  A database typically requires a comprehensive database software program known
  as a database management system (DBMS). A DBMS serves as an interface between
  the database and its end-users or programs, allowing users to retrieve,
  update, and manage how the information is organized and optimized. Some
  examples of popular database software or DBMSs include MySQL, Microsoft
  Access, Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB.

    <p>Data storage, retrieval and update</p>
    <ul>

        <p>
          All information in a digital repository is organized into a clear
          hierarchical structure with records, tables or objects. Every piece of
          information that you can add to your database will be organized in a
          kind of catalogue, so it will be easier for you to search and update
          your records later on.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support for transactions and concurrency</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Transaction is a collection of operations on the database that are
          bound together into a single run-time unit. The&nbsp;<span
            class="topic-highlight"
            >transaction manager</span
          >
          controls and coordinates the execution of transactions within the
          database.&nbsp;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When multiple users are accessing the database at the same time, and
          at least one is updating data, there may be the case of interference,
          which can result in data inconsistencies. Concurrency Manager in DBMS
          facilitates multiple users to access shared data in parallel without
          data inconsistencies.

      Enforcing constraints to ensure data in the database abides by certain
      rules
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          You can enforce rules by defining integrity constraints more reliably
          than by adding logic to your application. There are check constraints, cascades, triggers in DBMS 
          which help to keep database consistent.

    <p>Access support from remote locations</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Remote database access (RDA) is a protocol standard for database
          access it includes features for communicating database operations and
          parameters from the client to the server, in return transporting
          result data from the server to the client.

          The explosion of data coming in from sensors, connected machines, and

          Data breaches are happening everywhere these days, and hackers are

<h4><strong>why use Databases instead of a spreadsheet?</strong></h4>
<p>
  Spreadsheets were originally designed for one user. They&rsquo;re great for a
  single user or a small number of users who don&rsquo;t need to do a lot of
  incredibly complicated data manipulation. Databases, on the other hand, are
  designed to hold much larger collections of organized
  information&mdash;massive amounts, sometimes. Databases allow multiple users
  at the same time to quickly and securely access and query the data using
  highly complex logic and language.
