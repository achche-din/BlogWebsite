  <strong><span style="color: #993366">What is Database?</span></strong>
</h1>
<p>
  A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data,
  typically stored electronically in a computer system. Data stored in a
  database can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled,
  and organized using a &ldquo;database management system&rdquo;.
</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center">
  <strong><span style="color: #993366">What is Database?</span></strong>
</h1>
<p>
  A database typically requires a comprehensive database software program known
  as a database management system (DBMS). A DBMS serves as an interface between
  the database and its end-users or programs, allowing users to retrieve,
  update, and manage how the information is organized and optimized. Some
  examples of popular database software or DBMSs include MySQL, Microsoft
  Access, Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB.

          All information in a digital repository is organized into a clear
          hierarchical structure with records, tables or objects. Every piece of
          information that you can add to your database will be organized in a
          kind of catalogue, so it will be easier for you to search and update
          your records later on.

  <li>
    <p>Support for transactions and concurrency</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Transaction is a collection of operations on the database that are
          bound together into a single run-time unit. The&nbsp;<span
            class="topic-highlight"
            >transaction manager</span
          >
          controls and coordinates the execution of transactions within the
          database.&nbsp;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When multiple users are accessing the database at the same time, and
          at least one is updating data, there may be the case of interference,
          which can result in data inconsistencies. Concurrency Manager in DBMS
          facilitates multiple users to access shared data in parallel without
          data inconsistencies.

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          You can enforce rules by defining integrity constraints more reliably
          than by adding logic to your application. There are check constraints,
          cascades, triggers in DBMS which help to keep database consistent.

          Remote database access (RDA) is a protocol standard for database
          access it includes features for communicating database operations and
          parameters from the client to the server, in return transporting
          result data from the server to the client.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>why use Databases instead of a spreadsheet?</strong></h4>
<p>
  Spreadsheets were originally designed for one user. They&rsquo;re great for a
  single user or a small number of users who don&rsquo;t need to do a lot of
  incredibly complicated data manipulation. Databases, on the other hand, are
  designed to hold much larger collections of organized
  information&mdash;massive amounts, sometimes. Databases allow multiple users
  at the same time to quickly and securely access and query the data using
  highly complex logic and language.
</p>

CREATE TABLE Customer( CustomerId int, OrderId int PRIMARY
KEY(CustomerId,OrderId), FOREIGN KEY (OrderId) REFERENCES Order(OrderId), ON
DELETE [reference_option] ); * can use [ON UPDATE reference_option] to apply
update constraint CREATE Table Order( OrderId int, OrderName string, OrderAmount
double, PRIMARY KEY(OrderId) );

  <strong><span style="color: #993366">What is OOP?</span></strong>
</h1>
<p>
  OOPs stands for 'Object Oriented Programming'. It is a programming paradigm
  based on the concept of objects. Real-world entities can be modelled using
  objects which describes its attributes(fields) and behaviour(code which
  manipulates the attributes). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making
  them out of objects that interact with one another.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Modularity in Code for easier troubleshooting</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Something has gone wrong, and you have no idea where to look. With OOP
          you know exactly where to look. If an object functionality is broken
          you just have to look at its class and fix that functionality.

          In programming, there is a principle of DRY(do not repeat yourself).
          Code repetition is not good since if you want to change that code you
          need to change at multiple locations where that code is repeated
          making the code harder to maintain.

          provides different functionality from a method based on the situation
          through method overriding and method overloading. The same method can
          have different behaviour. suppose we have a method driveCar()
          sometimes when this method is invoked driveCar() is driving Mercedes
          and other time it could be BMW based on whether the car is BMW or
          Mercedes. You can read about it more

          We can hide the implementation details of a method using the concept
          of
          <a href="understand-abstraction"
            >Abstraction</a
          >. Implementators of the class can change implementation and no user
          of the class is affected as long as method signature remains the same.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <p>
      Object-oriented programming is often the most natural and pragmatic
      approach, once you get the hang of it. OOP languages allow you to break
      down your software into bite-sized problems that you then can solve
      &mdash; one object at a time
